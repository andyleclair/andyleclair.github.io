I was inspired by someone on my BlueSky timeline writing a weekly listening post, and it sounded like an excellent idea
for me to try to improve my writing process (or at least stick to a habit). Here's what I've been enjoying listening to this week:

## John Abercrombie, Jan Hammer, Jack DeJohnette - Timeless

RIP Jack DeJohnette! Timeless is right. I'm having a bit of a fusion kick this week.

## Pat Metheny - The Lore

It's just so much Metheny. I could have this on for hours.

## Geese - Getting Killed

Much has been said about this one, I've still got it in heavy rotation. I also snagged a live bootleg of a show of theirs in St. Paul, sounds like they're great live too.

## Troubled Hubble - Making Beds In A Burning House (20th Anniversary Edition)

A favorite from my youth, still sounds great after all these years.

## MJ Lenderman - And The Wind (Live and Loose!)

I wish more bands put out live albums. Live albums rock!
