I've had this album on constant rotation since I first heard [Becoming The Square](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ny2t1I6aTo) a few weeks ago.
It really hits. It's got a great vintage 90's indie rock sound (I mean, even ending with a Built To Spill cover),
the production is great, and the songwriting is fantastic. With three vocalists, there's a bit of range on the songs
and it keeps everything feeling fresh. I enjoy how each vocalist has their own style and they work well together.

Highlights of the album:
- Ipso Facto
- The Conversation's Over
- Cut Around a Corner
- The back half of Chia Pet
- Becoming The Square
- Any Way That You Cut It

I'm leaving Carry The Zero off the list, because it's not an original, but the cover definitely cranks.

Let's go track by track!

## Ipso Facto

Starting off the album with a neat little riff and then dropping into a more noodly, groovy
guitar line that's reminiscent of Meat Puppets, this is a great opening track. The chorus is catchy
and I find myself repeating "You think so, ipso facto, you are" in my head recently.

## The Conversation's Over

I love the chugging basswork and the vocal harmonies on this song. The riff on the bridge totally rocks.
The little keyboard line during the chorus is so catchy.

## Cut Around a Corner

## Chia Pet

I think I originally wasn't wild about this song, but it's starting to grow on me, and I really love
the back half of the song. We hit 2 minutes on this baby and there's a sick little riff before the drums come
back in and that takes us all the way to the end. 

## Becoming The Square
This was the first track I heard off of this album, I think it was a recommendation from "the algo". Good job, algo!
Kinda reminds me of Pavement, but in a way that I find less annoying? Anyway, great, catchy chorus and fun lyrics.

## Topaz

## Vultures in the Street

## Nancy (She Gets Around)

## Any Way That You Cut It

## Carry The Zero (Built To Spill cover)

This was maybe my favorite song when I was in high school? 10/10 no notes.


Overall I'd say this is a great album by a new band that I hope to hear more from!
