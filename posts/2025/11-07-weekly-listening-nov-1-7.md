It's been a long one, but I've enjoyed a few new things this week:

## They Are Gutting A Body Of Water - Lotto

https://theyareguttingabodyofwater.bandcamp.com/album/lotto

## Jack Alboher - Cornbliss Highway

https://ulyssa.bandcamp.com/album/cornbliss-highway

Really excited to hear the full release next week!

## Broken Social Scene - You Forgot It In People

https://brokensocialscene.bandcamp.com/album/you-forgot-it-in-people

A classic all-timer

## Drugdealer & Weyes Blood - Real Thing

https://drugdealerband.bandcamp.com/track/real-thing-2

Drugdealer can be sorta hit or miss for me, but this hits for sure.
