At some point in every engineer's career, they think "yes, I will create blog" and then usually they do.

This is my attempt at that. I've had a few blogs I actively maintained over the years (mostly music),
maybe this one will stick.

I plan to write about programming topics and music I enjoy listening to.

Stay tuned!
