I've got a pretty minimal microblogging site thing set up here. It's based on
[Nimble Publisher](https://github.com/dashbitco/nimble_publisher) which is a static site generator. It's ok, but it has
a few things I'd like to improve.

- LiveReload
- Recompiling on file changes

Adding those creature comforts from Phoenix would be nice. I'm guessing I could
rip off some other static site generator, this particular wheel has been
reinvented several times, and who am I to buck tradition?

I've deployed this site to Github Pages -- [source here!](https://github.com/andyleclair/andyleclair.github.io/)

Font is [Server Mono](https://servermono.com/). CSS is [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).
