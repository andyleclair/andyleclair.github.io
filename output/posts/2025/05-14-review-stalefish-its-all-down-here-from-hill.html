<p>
I’ve had this review on the back burner for a while, so I’m just gonna publish it. Perfect is the enemy of done, yeah?</p>
<p>
I’ve had this album on constant rotation since I first heard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ny2t1I6aTo">Becoming The Square</a> a few weeks ago.
It really hits. It’s got a great vintage 90’s indie rock sound (I mean, even ending with a Built To Spill cover),
the production is great, and the songwriting is fantastic. With three vocalists, there’s a bit of range on the songs
and it keeps everything feeling fresh. I enjoy how each vocalist has their own style and they work well together.</p>
<p>
Highlights of the album:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Ipso Facto  </li>
  <li>
The Conversation’s Over  </li>
  <li>
Cut Around a Corner  </li>
  <li>
The back half of Chia Pet  </li>
  <li>
Becoming The Square  </li>
  <li>
Any Way That You Cut It  </li>
</ul>
<p>
I’m leaving Carry The Zero off the list, because it’s not an original, but the cover definitely cranks.</p>
<p>
Some track highlights:</p>
<h2>
Ipso Facto</h2>
<p>
Starting off the album with a neat little riff and then dropping into a more noodly, groovy
guitar line that’s reminiscent of Meat Puppets, this is a great opening track. The chorus is catchy
and I find myself repeating “You think so, ipso facto, you are” in my head recently.</p>
<h2>
The Conversation’s Over</h2>

I love the chugging basswork and the vocal harmonies on this song. The riff on the bridge totally rocks.
The little keyboard line during the chorus is so catchy.</p>
<h2>
Chia Pet</h2>
<p>
I think I originally wasn’t wild about this song, but it’s starting to grow on me, and I really love
the back half of the song. We hit 2 minutes on this baby and there’s a sick little riff before the drums come
back in and that takes us all the way to the end.</p>
<h2>
Becoming The Square</h2>
<p>
This was the first track I heard off of this album, I think it was a recommendation from “the algo”. Good job, algo!
Kinda reminds me of Pavement, but in a way that I find less annoying? Anyway, great, catchy chorus and fun lyrics.</p>
<h2>
Carry The Zero (Built To Spill cover)</h2>
<p>
This was maybe my favorite song when I was in high school? 10/10 no notes.</p>
<p>
Overall I’d say this is a great album by a new band that I hope to hear more from!</p>
