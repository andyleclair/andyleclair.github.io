As a <del>bonafide sucker</del> fan of <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/theprimeagen">The Primeagen</a> and <del>idiot money waster</del> coffee enthusiast, I was excited to try out some coffee from <a href="https://terminal.shop/">terminal.shop</a>.</p>
<h2>
Ordering</h2>
<p>
If you don’t know, you can <em>only</em> order coffee from terminal.shop over SSH. Yes, really. 100%. I expected some level of jank in the process,
but honestly the entire experience was really, really slick. I don’t want to ruin the experience, so, do yourself a favor and fire up the ol’ SSH machine:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">ssh terminal.shop</code></pre>
<p>
I didn’t have my credit card on me, but they have an option to pop a browser open (where I have my card saved), which seamlessly hands off the sale, then hands it back to the terminal when
payment is accepted. Again: really slick.</p>
<h2>
The Beans</h2>
<p>
I purchased the Flow and Segfault beans. Shipping was decently quick, and the bags look nice. The <a href="https://www.terminal.shop/cron">Cron</a> subscription boxes look a bit fancier, but the “regular” packaging is nice too.</p>

<h2>
The Coffee</h2>
<p>
I’m brewing on my Gaggia Classic Pro Evo and grinding with a Niche Zero. I don’t feel like the Evo needs the temp-surfing that the earlier models do, so I just send it when the light turns red.
Portafilter is the GCP stock porta with a fancy pants Wiedemann handle. I’m tamping with the <a href="https://decentespresso.com/tamper">Decent V6 calibrated tamper</a>. Grind size is between 20 and 21.</p>
<p>
I’m pulling doppio shots, 18g of coffee, and I don’t weigh my shots because I don’t have a scale that fits under, but I timed them to around 30 seconds, which I think is close to “right” for some values of right.</p>

</p>
<p>
The verdict? It’s good! It’s not like, <em>mindblowing</em> but it’s totally drinkable. I think the tasting notes come through (not that I’m a seasoned cupper or anything) and I like what comes out of the machine.
Both beans are tasty, and I don’t regret the purchase at all. I think I like them both about the same. That said, I don’t think that they’re about to replace my daily driver.</p>
<p>
We usually get <a href="https://speckledax.com/">Speckled Ax</a> Corduroy blend 5lbs at a time, so, it’s tough for really anybody to compete with super high quality, locally roasted coffee, and we have a <em>lot</em> of that in Portland.
I absolutely <em>love</em> the coffee we get from Speckled Ax, but they’re a tough competitor! I don’t think anyone is expecting, like, Blue Bottle (to use a well-known roaster) but I do think the terminal beans are good.</p>
<h2>
Minor Gripes</h2>
<p>
My only bummer note is that the bags didn’t have a roasted on date on them. There is a spot on the bottom of the bag where it <em>should</em> go, but both bags were blank. Bummer! I do actually care when my beans
were roasted (you should too!) and I think it’s a pretty big miss to not have that on the bag. I know that terminal.shop is a meme, but I think they should take the coffee part seriously.</p>

</p>
<p>
I am reasonably sure that Prime and TJ (maybe they make Dax do it) aren’t like, out in the shop roasting the beans by hand, but whoever they are white-labelling through should put that info on the bag.
I wanna know it wasn’t sitting in a warehouse for 6 months before it gets to me! </p>
<p>
That all said, I would definitely order from terminal again, and signed up for a Cron subscription, so i’m excited to see what that brings. Thanks for the beans!</p>
